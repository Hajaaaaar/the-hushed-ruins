# The Hushed Ruins (Android)

**The Hushed Ruins** is an accessibility-first mobile game prototype designed for players with **motor** and **hearing** impairments.  
Built with **MIT App Inventor**, it supports **voice commands** (fixed set) and **on-screen buttons** as a fallback, with clear visual + haptic feedback.

> Built as coursework focusing on accessibility, usability, and narrative-driven design.

## Highlights

- **Voice input with a fixed command set** (e.g., “up”, “down”, “left”, “right”) to navigate and answer riddles.
- **Multimodal interaction**: voice **or** buttons, so players can always progress.
- **Haptic & visual feedback** (color changes, vibration) for correct/incorrect actions and state changes. 
- **Riddle system + hinting** to support different abilities and reduce frustration.
- Designed with **WCAG/ISO usability principles** in mind.

## Install

- **Android APK**: download from **Releases** and install on device (enable “Install unknown apps”).  
- **Android App Bundle (.aab)**: intended for Play Console distribution; not installable directly.

## Controls

- **Voice**: “up”, “down”, “left”, “right” (and simple riddle answers).
- **Touch fallback**: on-screen buttons mirror the voice commands.

## Accessibility Notes

- Large, high-contrast UI and clear instructions reduce cognitive/visual load.
- Immediate, consistent feedback (visual + haptic) to indicate success, errors, and progress.
- MVP scope intentionally **avoids personal data storage**; focus is on interaction and feedback.
